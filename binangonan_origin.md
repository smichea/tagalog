# The Legend of Binangonan in *L’origine des Philippines* (2003)

Marina Pottier-Quirolgico includes a chapter called “La légende de Binangonan” in her bilingual French-Tagalog collection *L’origine des Philippines: Mythes de la création* (2003). This legend, originally sourced from a 1949 compilation by Hugues Jean de Dianoux, tells a tragic tale to explain the origin of the town’s name. In Pottier-Quirolgico’s retelling, a man drowned in a storm is miraculously revived on the shores of a lakeside village. The villagers exclaim that “*bumangon ang patay*” – literally “the dead person rose” – and thereafter refer to that shoreline as *“binangunan ng patay”* (the place where the dead rose). The story continues with a romance between the revived man and the local chief’s (or mayor’s) daughter. When their forbidden love ends in both lovers’ deaths, they are buried at the very spot where the man had risen. From then on, according to the myth, people named that place **Binangonan**. In other tellings, villagers later even see the spirits of the two lovers *“nagbabangon”* (rising) at night on that spot – reinforcing the connection between the name *Binangonan* and the act of rising from death.

## “Monument funéraire” – Pottier-Quirolgico’s Translation of *Binangonan*

In her book, Pottier-Quirolgico translates **“Binangonan” as *“monument funéraire”*** (French for “funerary monument” or tomb). She uses this interpretation to tie the place-name to the legend’s outcome: the site becomes a **burial monument** for the ill-fated lovers. Essentially, she treats *Binangonan* as a commemorative marker of a **death and burial** in the story. Pottier-Quirolgico explicitly notes that *Binangonan* *“signifie monument funéraire”* (meaning *funerary monument*) – a gloss that highlights the grave or tomb-like significance of the location in the myth’s context. This suggests she arrived at that translation by viewing the **place where the lovers were buried as a memorial** for them. The narrative indeed frames the spot as hallowed by tragedy: *“Doon na rin sa lugar na pinagbangunan inilibing ang mga bangkay. Magmula noon ang pook na iyon ay tinawag na Binangonan.”* (“Right there at the place where he had risen, the two corpses were buried. From then on that locale was called Binangonan.”). By interpreting the name as *monument funéraire*, Pottier-Quirolgico emphasizes that **Binangonan is the tomb or funerary marker of the story’s protagonists** – effectively a monument to their death.

It’s worth noting that this translation likely stems from the **mythological and cultural angle** rather than strict linguistics. In the legend’s logic, the site of the resurrection and subsequent burial is sacred, akin to a memorial. Describing Binangonan as a *monument funéraire* captures that sense of a **sacred burial site**. Pottier-Quirolgico does not appear to provide a detailed linguistic breakdown of the word in her text, but instead gives this interpretive meaning to enrich the storytelling. She may have been influenced by the fact that the **root word “bangon” means “to rise”**, often in the sense of *rising from sleep or death*, which in a funerary context can imply *resurrection*. By extension, the place associated with a dead person rising could be seen as a **monument of that resurrection** – effectively a tomb with a story behind it. Thus, *“monument funéraire”* succinctly conveys to her readers the **fateful, death-related significance** of *Binangonan* in the legend.

## Sources and Evidence in Pottier-Quirolgico’s Book

Pottier-Quirolgico supports her rendition of the Binangonan myth by citing earlier work. In the introduction or bibliography, she credits *“La légende de Binangonan. Hugues Jean de Dianoux, Alamat na mga Kayumanggi, Manille, 1949”* as her source. This indicates she drew the story from Dianoux’s *Alamat ng mga Kayumanggi* (“Legends of the Brown People”), a 1949 Manila publication of Filipino folklore. That source likely provided the narrative framework (and possibly a Tagalog text) which she then translated into French. Any linguistic or historical commentary Pottier-Quirolgico offers is brief. Her focus is on retelling the tale, so the explanation of *Binangonan* as *monument funéraire* is probably given in passing (for example, in a footnote or parenthetical aside) rather than as a full etymological discussion. The **context** in which she uses the term is the finale of the legend – when naming the place – thereby directly linking her translation to the **myth’s climax** (the burial of the lovers and the naming of the town).

It does not appear that Pottier-Quirolgico cites academic linguistic sources for the name; instead, the **evidence she leans on is the content of the legend itself**. The imagery of the lovers’ grave and the local lore of spirits rising is the basis for calling it a funerary monument. By framing the name this way, she ensures that even readers unfamiliar with Tagalog grasp the import of the name in the story. In sum, the **mythological explanation** is her primary justification: *Binangonan* is where a dead man rose and two lovers died, *“thus it serves as a funerary monument”* in the story’s world.

## Alignment vs. Contradiction with Known Etymologies of "Binangonan"

Pottier-Quirolgico’s interpretation of *Binangonan* as a *monument funéraire* is **rooted in the folklore** but differs from the usual scholarly etymology of the name. Linguistically, *Binangonan* is commonly traced to the Tagalog word ***bangon*** (“to rise” or “to get up”). The construction *bángon + -an* (with infix -in-) suggests a place *“where rising happened”* or *“where someone/something rose.”* Indeed, historical sources and local historians say the name refers to a place *“from where someone or something rose.”* For example, the town’s official history notes that **binañgonan** comes from *bangon* (rise), alluding to *“the place where events or people had arisen.”* This could refer to a literal rising (as in a **resurrection** – which is exactly what the legend describes) or metaphorically to an uprising or beginning. One folk explanation claims *Binañgonan* means *“the first town established along the lake,”* i.e. the place that *rose* first among the lakeshore settlements. In either case, the emphasis is on *rising* or *emergence*, not explicitly on a tomb.

By contrast, translating *Binangonan* as a **funerary monument** shifts the nuance from *the act of rising* to the *memorialization of death*. This **partially aligns** with the legend (since the legend’s *“rising”* happens at a spot that becomes a grave), but it **contradicts the straightforward linguistic meaning**. The legend itself can be interpreted two ways – one highlighting the **resurrection** (“*bumangon ang patay*” – the dead rose) and the other highlighting the **burial site** (the lovers’ tomb). Pottier-Quirolgico’s take leans toward the latter. In doing so, it does not match the typical translation of the root word *bangon*. As one source puts it, *Binangonan* in Tagalog is derived from *bangon* (“to rise”), so the name is tied to *“where events or people had arisen.”* This is a more general notion of rising, without specifying that it was a **funeral**.

Moreover, local historians sometimes mention that during the Spanish era the town’s name was maliciously punningly called *“Binangonan de los Perros”* (“Binangonan of the dogs”) by colonial authorities, implying *binangonan* was understood as a standalone word (not needing translation as tomb). Pottier-Quirolgico’s interpretation is therefore **unusual** from a purely etymological perspective. It emphasizes a *mythic-symbolic meaning* rather than the accepted linguistic origin.

In summary, Marina Pottier-Quirolgico arrived at *“monument funéraire”* for *Binangonan* by following the **myth’s storyline** – viewing the town’s name as a reference to a **funeral marker for the dead lovers** in the legend. She provides this translation in context, likely to help readers understand the symbolic significance of the name in the creation-myth. While this interpretation makes sense within the *folkloric narrative*, it **diverges from the standard etymology**, which ties *Binangonan* to the idea of *“rising”* (whether of people, spirits, or even the community itself) rather than explicitly to a grave. In other words, Pottier-Quirolgico’s *monument funéraire* aligns with the **mythological explanation** of Binangonan’s origin but does not strictly align with the **linguistic/historical origin** of the term as understood by scholars. Her translation underscores the *commemorative, funeral aspect* of the story’s locale, even as the known etymology emphasizes the action of *rising*. Both interpretations stem from the same legendary events, but they highlight different facets – one memorializes death, the other celebrates resurrection.
